Talk title:
Now you're cooking with DAGs: an introduction to Tarjan's Strongly Connected Components algorithm!!

Abstract for your talk:
What do Git, build tools, and the Boolean satisfiability problem have in common?

Timeline for your talk:
2 min: Drawing a Git repo
  - Git commits form a directed acyclic graph, because hashes
  - Git commits can't have any cycles, so check for those
  - Helpful error messages: Point out where the cycle is
  - Git hashes include hashes of parents, so hash parents and then children
2 min: Finding Tarjan's SCC algorithm
  - StackOverflow -> Wikipedia
  - What's a strongly connected component?
  - What's a topological sort? Why do we want a reverse topological sort?
  - SCCs and reverse topological sorting in linear time!
  - Knuth's favourite!
3 min: It works!
  - Walk through the counterexample from the Wikipedia page
  - Walk through a DAG
3 min: Other applications
  - Build tools/data flow systems
  - Boolean satisfiability (2SAT)
  - Any possibly-DAG you have to process!

Intended audience:
Anyone who likes algorithm visualisations and/or graphs!
