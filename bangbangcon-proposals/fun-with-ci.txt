Talk title:
Testing is boring, let's mine Bitcoin! (Ab)using CI for fun and profit!

Abstract for your talk:
CI is inextricably linked with testing, but testing is boring! We can do so
much more than that that it's worth exploring those possibilities. Perhaps you
will be inspired to apply CI to your next problem!

Timeline for your talk:
1 min: Intro
  - Testing is the least interesting application of CI
  - We can do so much more!
  - It's a platform for arbitrary code execution!
  - It's free (or can be)!
3 min: Documenting with CI
  - Pandoc + LaTeX can be installed/cached as part of a build process!
  - You can push to a git repo (or another branch of your current repo)!
  - Applications: blogs, presentations, documents
3 min: Deploying with CI
  - Configuration as code means you can deploy/update infrastructure as part of
    your CI process (also known as CD)!
  - Terraform/Docker/etc.
  - Jenkins etc. makes a great dashboard for executing deploys, see
    http://rundeck.org/index.html
  - Examples like those in (https://vadosware.io/post/fun-with-gitlab-ci/) (note to reviewers: not my blog :D)
2 min: More half-baked ideas!
  - Travis-driven development: make a change, let the CI build tell you what's
    wrong, and iterate! If you've ever wondered what development on mainframes
    was like, you might enjoy this :)
  - Mining Bitcoin (don't do this!): a discussion about https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/nzkxgm/bitcoin-mining-github-open-source-bots
1 min: Conclusion
  - CI infrastructure is a playground
  - I think it's worth thinking about the possibilities instead of blindly
    following best practices :)

Intended audience:
  - Anyone excited about automating things for free!
